Logistic Regression Model for Cancerous Tumor Prediction

Objective:
The objective of this project is to design and implement a logistic regression model that predicts whether a tumor is cancerous or not based on its size. 
The system will use Scikit-Learn library to train the model and make predictions.

Description:
This project aims to create a predictive model for diagnosing cancerous tumors based on their size. 
The model uses logistic regression, which is a statistical technique used for classification problems. 
The system takes in tumor size as input and outputs whether the tumor is cancerous (1) or not (0).

Features:
Data Preparation: The project defines two arrays: `x_param`, which represents the size of the tumor in centimeters, and `y_param`, which indicates whether the tumor is cancerous (1) or not (0).
Model Training: The code trains a logistic regression model using Scikit-Learn's `LogisticRegression` class.
Prediction: The system uses the trained model to predict whether a given tumor size is cancerous or not.
